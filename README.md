# Responsive-Portfolio

This project uses *media queries* to make my Basic Porfolio webpage mobile/tablet accessible/friendly.

With the help of a window resizer, or ability to access this page via a mobile device/tablet, users can view the my new *mobile friendly* Portfolio that resizes windows and allows for an aesthetically pleasing webpage.

To navigate, simply open up the link to the **About Me** Homepage and use the navigation bar at the top right to move to the respective pages.
